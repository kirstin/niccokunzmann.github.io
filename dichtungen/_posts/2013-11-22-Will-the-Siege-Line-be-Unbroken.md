	[CHORUS]
	C                      C7
	will the siege line be unbroken 
	        F              C
	bye bye locusts by and by
	C                C7
	there's a mu-ta-lisk awaiting 
	       C      G      C
	in the sky up in the sky
	
	[Verse 1]
	I was sitting by a tower
	on a cold and cloudy day, 
	when I saw the tanks come rolling
	for to take my bases away.
	
	[CHORUS]
	
	[Verse 2]
	So I told the siege tank driver
	siege tank driver please drive slow
	for these bases you are heading for - 
	oh I'd hate to see them go.
	
	[CHORUS]
	
	[Verse 3]
	So I flew there - right behind them
	tried to harass them and be brave
	but I could not hold my sorrow
	when they stimmed them to their grave.
	
	[CHORUS]
	
	[Verse 4]
	I went back home to my buildings - 
	my expansions almost gone
	where my swarmhost eggs were lying, 
	and in seconds almost done
	
	[CHORUS singen - ende einspielen]
	
	[Verse 5]
	All the drones turned into crawlers
	we built all that made us strong
	did what master players told us
	hear the casters sing along
	
	[CHORUS]
	[CHORUS]
