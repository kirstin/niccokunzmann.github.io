title: Santa Clause is coming to drown - between the lines
language: en
---

Many popular songs are shaped through the language of punishment, reward,
sin, debt, fault, and redemption.  
I like to rephrase them for authenticity and peace and humanity.  
- This is the essence of "between the lines" - making clear what this song is
truly about.

This is a remake of the song ["Santa Claus is coming to town"](http://www.metrolyrics.com/santa-claus-is-coming-to-town-lyrics-christmas-song.html)

  You better watch out
  You better not cry
  you better just hide
( -   "    - ignore )
  what is inside
  'cause Sante Claus will punish it out!
(                                no doubt! )
(                                around! )

  If you believe in this -
  That he makes a list
( That he's making a list )
  He is some kind of god
( He is (kind of) a god )
  and he should be dismissed,
  'case there shall be only one god around!
  
  If he knows when you are sleeping
  And he knows when you're awake
  He is working for the NSA
  And much more is at stake.
  
  You better straight out
  Be telling a lie
  Garble your heart and
  Make your feelings die
  'cause Santa Claus will reward it, no doubt!

```
