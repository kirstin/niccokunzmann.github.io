title: Santa Clause is coming to drown - between the lines
language: en
---

Many popular songs are shaped through the language of punishment, reward,
sin, debt, fault, and redemption.  
I like to rephrase them for authenticity and peace and humanity.  
- This is the essence of "between the lines" - making clear what this song is
truly about.

This is a remake of the song ["Santa Claus is coming to town"](http://www.metrolyrics.com/santa-claus-is-coming-to-town-lyrics-christmas-song.html)

       G
  You better watch out
       C
  You better not cry
       G
  you better just hide
( -   "    - ignore )
    C
  what is inside
          G      Em        Am    D7 G
  'cause Santa Claus will punish it out!
(                                no doubt! )
(                                around! )
          G
  If you believe in this -
           C
  That he makes a list
( That he's making a list )
              G
  He is some kind of god
( He is (kind of) a god )
          C
  and he should be dismissed:
          G       Em   Am      D7 G
  There shall be only one god around!
  
         Dm        G       C
  If he knows when you are sleeping
         Dm         G      C
  And he knows when you're awake
        Em      A       D
  He is working for the NSA
      Em        A     D
  And much more is at stake.
  
       G
  You better straight out
      C
  Be telling a lie
   G
  Garble your heart,
            C
  Make your feelings die
          G     Em    Am         D7  G
  'cause Santa Claus rewards it, no doubt!
