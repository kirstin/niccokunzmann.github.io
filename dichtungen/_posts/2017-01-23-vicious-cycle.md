I met a person who was sad  
but certainly not dead  
inside. Told me,  
how he worked  
and of his decline  
how he could not pursue his dreams  
how he liked to do good but neither posseses the means  
nor knows where to get them.  

So, I called  
And he was in the vicious cycle  
in his head  
and this cycle made his reality.

Em                  Am
Should I do this or should I do that?
Em       Am          Dm
I fear I might not suffice
Em         Am    Dm
I fear the air I breathe

Welcome to the vicious cycle

What is it that they want form me?
They do not care how I feel.
I fear they demand
I fear that they will come for me

Welcome to the vicious cycle

Where I look I see my inability
They demand I don't deliver
They will come for me
I shiver

Welcome to the vicious cycle

 What is it that they want form me?
 Is it my life?
 Is it my sanity?
[Is it what shines in me?]
 Will I break
 Or fall into slavery?

Welcome to the vicious cycle

Of all the things I lost,
I miss my joy the most.

Welcome to the vicious cycle

You can't escape. It's in your head.
It is everywhere you see.
It is everywhere you tread.
The path out is empathy.
