I stumbled upon this PyCon2016 talk. Whereas test-driven development is feeling the love of many people, I got reminded what it is really about: documenting behavior in code. So when I read the title I was inclined to listen to the talk. Only 26 views seem little for what it is: taking TDD to the next level.

There is some truth in it:

> [...] understand information as the process of informing - as an activity. Understand documentation as a process of documenting [...] [[Minute 13 Second 13](https://youtu.be/x5rGUqRWlK8?t=13m13s)] 

What can your Project do?
-------------------------

From the talk...

- It has to do with attitudes.
- Structure documentation well. 
- There is a documentation about how the documentatoin works
  - tutorial
  - how to
  - reference
  - topics
- Make documentation policies as rigorous as your code policies.
- Attend a writethedocs.org workshop.
- Have a documentation manager.
- Spend monay and time on documentation.
- Documentation becomes a movement.

What I take from it
-------------------

Documentation is often seen as something noone likes. But with the Django Project we can see that documentation actually drives development as it gets new people in and (in)forms the commuity.
