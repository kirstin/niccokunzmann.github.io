Hey you there,  
I do not like you.  
You are not conform to the system.  
But there is a pretty way of saying what I mean:

> You are a water melon:
> 
> - green from the outside
> - red from the inside
> - a socialist an anarchist,
> - essentially, you eat little babies.

I could talk to you  
but I don't have to.  
There is an enemy indoctrinated,  
So I will label you.  
What good is talking to you if  
I don't? You see ...  

> You are a right-winger:
> 
> - a facist, a neonazi
> - a radical, brutal
> - deconstitutor
 
I dispise what is human in you  
Because it reminds me of myself.

I have not killed your wife,  
I just do not care.  
Someone from my country pulverized  
Your child? But not me, you see ...  
Let me say it through the flower!

> You are a terrorist:
> 
> - human from the outside
> - zombie from the inside
> - no feelings, no empathy, everything
> - negative I do not want to be but certainly am.

And you label me as enemy?  
How dare you do not see that I am  
different and you are all the same!

With this poem I hope you can see the other side.
