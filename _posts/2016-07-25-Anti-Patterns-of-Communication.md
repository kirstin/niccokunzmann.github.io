title: Anti Patterns of Communication

I spent time on thinking about Nonviolent Comunication. I watched [videos of Marshal Rosenberg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwXH4hNfgPg). They give the context for this essay.

I'd rather call it peaceful communication or "Giraffe". I was raised with the other language which Marshal names "Jackal".

In this blog post I want to present some patterns of Jackal language I use, analyse them and present responses to it, either by me, recognizing this language, or by others.

Note that these patterns apply to a communiaction style and thus apply to people, groups and states.


Jackal Pattern 1: Create Guilt and Offer Redemption
---------------------------------------------------

### In one short sentence

I do not want to do X so I make you feel guilty and offer redemtion throught doing X for me.

### Context

You want an action X to be done in order to achieve goal Y.
You do not want to do X, that is a given. You are willing to make other people suffer so they do it in your place.

### Problem

The other person resists all your attempts of pressure.
These attempts could be:

- Make the other person believe they should have done it earlier when it was easy to do, now they owe this deed. "You could have printed this when you were at the office."
- Make the other person believe you would suffer if they decline. "I am under so much pressure already."
- Make the other person responsible for your actions. "I want to do so much good and you hinder me if I do X."
- Make the other person ignore their own wishes. "You always take and never give back."
- Generalize and specialize excluding yourself. "It is important to do X. So you should do X from time to time. From time to time is when I say it."
  - Appeal to a stereotype that includes the person but excludes you. "Men cannot cook."
- To amplify the preasure, amplify the feeling of guilt. The person that should feel guilt assumes other people think alike. Get other people to listen to the conversation. Even if they do not respond, they amplify the preassure. To amplify it even more, let them agree with you once you created some guilt.

### Solution

Talk to the other person.

1. Begin with the goal Y that you would like to achieve.
2. Say how this improves your life.
3. Tell the strategy you would like to use. Oftentimes they know an other strategy that can help, too.
4. Tell the person what hinders you to do the strategy.
5. Ask for help and council.

These steps can help instead of the other person refusing to surrender.

Jackal Pattern 2: Divide and Conquer
------------------------------------

### In a short sentence
Tear resolve the connection between two people and focus on them separately.

Jackal Pattern 3: Generalize and Specialize
-------------------------------------------

### Context

This is especially easy in Jackal language since it diffuses

- Responsibility through "must", "should"
  - Removing the subject: "The language does ..."
- Feelings through "good", "bad"
- Character through stereotypes: "men", "nazis"
- People through group affiliation: "they", "we"
- Processes through Nouns: "affiliation"

### In a short sentence

We do it so you must do it or you are not one of us.

The pattern schema was borrowed from the book "Generative Beauty Patterns" by the Generative Beauty Project, Iba Laboratory, Keio University, Endo, Japan issued in 2012. This book can be found in an other pattern style [here](hillside.net/plop/2012/papers/Writing%20Group/Generative%20Beauty%20Patterns.pdf).
