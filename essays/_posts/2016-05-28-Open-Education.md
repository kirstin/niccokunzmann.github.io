Now, I read a few blog posts that I would like to share:

- [Of Openness, Ecosystems, and Type I and Type II Error](http://opencontent.org/blog/archives/4585)
- [So, Open?](http://andrewrikard.com/notes/2016/05/25/oer-open-and-the-business-of-it-all.html)
- [The Web We Need to Give Students - a domain on ones own](https://medium.com/bright/the-web-we-need-to-give-students-311d97713713#.9epsai2a7)

Thoughts about these that I would like to share:
